    <h1>Week 03 Notes:</h1>

    
<p>let user = {
  name: "John",
  age: 30
};</p>

</p>user.sayHi = function() {
  alert("Hello!");
};</p>

</p>user.sayHi(); // Hello!
In this code example why doesn’t it look like:
Let user ={
Name : “John”;
Age: 30,
sayHi(){
}
}
</p>

</p>I guess my question when you are declaring the object user why isn’t the method also in the same brackets?<br><br>
•	“In JavaScript this is “free”, its value is evaluated at call-time and does not depend on where the method was declared, but rather on what object is “before the dot”. <br><br>This seems very useful but dangerous if you rely on it too much. Might almost make you forget how to program properly haha<br><br>
•	Because the “this” is defined at run time that can give you a lot of flexibility<br><br>
•	Can you have a regular expression function to be used multiple times?<br><br>
•	You can do a lot more with the DOM than I realized. I did not know that there were so many built in methods for DOM objects.<br><br>

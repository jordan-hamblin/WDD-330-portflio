    <h1>Week 08 Notes</h1>

    <p>In industry is is better practise to use straight CSS or use something like bootstrap?</p>
    
    <p>Also in industry are most web applications focused on modern browsers or do they still
    provide a lot of focus on outdated browsers?</p>
    
    <p>How detailed can the canvas feature be? Would is it limited to basic shapes and lines?</p>
    
    <p>Is there an industry standard between canvas, and svg?</p>
    
    <p>To be honest I was a little confused about how to do the working examples in this reading.
    Because the chapters were referencing things that happened in chapters we did not read.</p>

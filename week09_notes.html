    <h1>Week 09 Notes</h1>

    <p>I thought it was kind of funny how halfway through it said don't use any of the stuff you just read haha.</p>

    <p>Global variables are normally frowned upon. Is it different in javascript?</p>

    <p>What would happen if you used any of the location methods without asking for permission?</p>

    <p>I don't really see the point of using workers if we are going to writing code asynchronously. 
        Is there a significant difference?</p>

    <p>I am having a little bit of a tough time visualizing what a web socket is. To me two people could communicate
        in the same way with one server between them. What am I missing?</p>

    <h1>Notes</h1>
    
        <p>I have used a little bit of both html built in validation and javascript validation. I have found the built in
            validation a lot simpler to use. How common is it to use javascript validation in industry? Does it come down
            to personal preference or is there an industry standard?</p><br>
        <p>Along the same lines, in industry if you do use the javascript validation are you using API's or is it
            completely custom?</p><br>
        <p>Is Fetch or AJAX used more in modern web development? I am more familiar with Ajax so it would be nice to be
            able to keep using that but if Fetch is the way to go I will probably switch.</p><br>
        <p>From the reading it seems like fetch is better at error handling than AJAX as well as interacting with different
            functions. Is there any apparent advantage of AJAX over fetch?</p><br>

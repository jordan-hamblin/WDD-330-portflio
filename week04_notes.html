    <h1>Week o4 Notes</h1>
<p>•	Previously using forms I have just used getElementsByID to reference the form 
    I wanted in javascript. Is there a significant benefit to using the const 
    form = document.forms['hero']; </p>
    <p>•	I am still rusty on the arrow syntax for functions. I am contemplating switching
    how I write my functions but what is mainly used in industry? Or is it just personal preference?</p>
    <p>•	I am a little confused as to when to use a constructor function in a class 
    as compared to creating an object literal?</p>
    <p>•	What is more efficient using prototypes or classes or a creating straight 
    from an object. Once again is it just personal preference or is there a standard for industry?</p>

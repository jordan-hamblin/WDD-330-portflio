    <h1>Week 05 Questions</h1>
    <p>What is the actual change in strict code in Javascript? The reading said that they were different
    but what were the actual differences in syntax and rules?</p>

    <p>Ive never heard of a finally in a try catch block. Why is this necessary? The reading siad that 
    it is for code to always run whether an exception is thrown or not. Shouldn't I just right normal 
    code after the try catch block to accomplish the same thing with less code? What is the advantage
    to the finally?</p>

    <p>For writing tests in industry are you normally writing tests for your own code or is someones
    specific job to write the tests and another person to write the code to pass those test?</p>

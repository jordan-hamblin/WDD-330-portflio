    <h1>Week 02 Notes</h1>
    <h2>Question</h2>
        •	What are the advantages of arrow function declarations over normal function declarations? Is it only that it takes less lines to code? <br>
        •	For using a callback how different is it than calling a function in any other programming language or is it the same thing? I was a little confused at how you can pas the function. <br>
        •	Is there a best way to declare functions? What I mean by this is their an industry standard or is it just up to personal preference?<br>
    <h2>Observations:</h2>
        •	I really like that constructors are not recommended in Javascript. This makes creating objects much simpler using a literal declaration.<br>
        •	I am a little concerned tough about how so many things are automated in javascript. It makes me worry that I might forget how to do a lot of programming things.<br>

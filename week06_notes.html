    <h1>Week 06 Notes</h1>
    

<p>How significant is the memory cost for storing the results in cache?</p>
 
<p>Is an IIFE kind of like an onload function but can happen at times different times than when the page is loading?</p>

<p>Are functions that define and reqwite themselves industry approved? That seems kind of dangerous to me.</p>

<p>Pure functions sound pretty good. Is that the way that industry is leaning in JavaScript is OOP still the preferred way?</p>
